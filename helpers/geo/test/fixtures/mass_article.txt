At a community meeting Monday in Chelsea, a group of immigrant advocates, police, and city officials gathered to address residents’ pressing fears about recent immigration enforcement tactics. The broken car windows, the masked agents dragging individuals out of cars, people being whisked off the streets without warrants.

Rosalba Ventura, a mother and lifelong Chelsea resident, told those in the crowd she took video of one such incident that very morning, after dropping her kids off at school.

“Have you shown a warrant?” she asked the officers, multiple times, yelling expletives at them.

Ventura, 36, later told the Globe she felt angry to see the agents covering their faces, and she advised the driver in Spanish, “don‘t sign anything, and don‘t say anything,” saying she could call someone on their behalf.

“It’s scary, people should not live like this,” she said.

Across the state, similar encounters of protest — and also resistance — are increasingly playing out. In Acton just over a week ago, as Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were arresting two women — one crying and screaming that her children were at home — roughly 30 people showed up, some who heard about the action through a hot line recently set up to mobilize such groups.

That same weekend, an ICE action in Worcester turned frantic as residents showed up to protest and police were called. City officials released police body camera footage Friday showing residents trying to disrupt the ICE operation, pleading for agents to release a woman they arrested in front of her daughters.

As ICE has ramped up arrests in local communities, often with strong-arm tactics, agents are starting to see more resistance, not only from immigrants and their advocates but also from co-workers and neighbors.

“There are more folks willing to step up and support,” said Dálida Rocha with the LUCE Immigrant Justice Network of Massachusetts, which runs the primary hot line to report ICE sightings. “In a moment where the [Trump] administration was hoping for the community to be truly divided, it shows that we’re not.”

The resistance to ICE actions has increased as operations have become more visible and brazen. In Chelsea, federal officials broke the car window of a man leaving church on Mother‘s Day, video footage showed, before throwing him to the ground and arresting him. In Waltham last week, City Councilor Colleen Bradley-MacArthur said she saw a 12-year-old boy left alone on the sidewalk after ICE detained the adult he was with. Volunteers with a local Neighborhood Watch group who showed up to monitor ICE walked the boy home.

“They’re operating like bullies, and I just think people’s tolerance level for bullies is low,” said Bradley-MacArthur, who recorded the Waltham incident. “When you can hear ICE agents saying, ‘We know you’re an immigrant, we know you’re illegal,’ [using] these types of tactics, using fear and intimidation, I don‘t think people are willing to put up with that in their communities.”

Federal data show what people are perceiving. Though the overall number of detentions is no different than under the previous administration, the number of people arrested within local communities has significantly ramped up under President Trump, with roughly 18,000 book-ins of people living in the country (as opposed to entering the border) in April compared to about 8,000 in December. ICE did not respond to a request for the number of recent arrests in Massachusetts.


To be clear, ICE officials defend their enforcement actions and describe them as essential to protect public safety. The agency also defended agents covering their faces during operations, a practice that has drawn the ire of advocates who describe those detentions as “kidnappings.”

“When our heroic law enforcement officers conduct operations, they clearly identify themselves as police while wearing masks to protect themselves from being targeted,” a DHS spokesperson said in a statement

Legal observers say recent arrests seem to follow different standards and protocols.

While the Biden administration focused enforcement on immigrants with serious criminal histories or prior deportations, the Trump administration has widened its scope. ICE agents going after specific individuals now often make “collateral arrests” when they encounter other undocumented immigrants, including people without criminal histories.

“In the previous administration, there was a lot of boxes that needed to be checked before they could take anyone into custody,” said Jace Calderas, a former ICE agent who retired in 2016 and now runs a security consulting firm. “Now, basically anybody who‘s here illegally is fair game.”

Last week, the mayor and City Council in Lynn released a statement noting that shift, saying they had seen an “escalation of ICE activity,” including an increase in collateral detentions, elevating “unrest and fear” in the community.

Tensions recently flared so much that Essex County Sheriff Kevin Coppinger urged people to calm down. The increasingly hostile encounters also drew attention from US Attorney Leah Foley, who last week condemned recent “interference” with ICE operations and pledged to investigate anyone who illegally obstructs immigration agents.

“This conduct poses significant public and officer safety risks. It is conduct that should be vilified rather than glorified,” Foley said in a statement. “I will not stand idly by if any public official, public safety officer, organization or private citizen acts in a manner that criminally obstructs or impedes ICE operations.”

This month, a federal grand jury indicted a Wisconsin judge for allegedly helping a defendant in her courtroom evade waiting immigration agents.

“People need to be careful,” said Paul Hunker, the chief counsel for ICE’s Dallas branch from 2003 until January 2024. “This administration is aggressively prosecuting people who are impeding.”

Under the federal Immigration and Nationality Act, federal agents generally require an administrative warrant to arrest people for civil immigration violations but can conduct warrantless arrests if they believe someone is in the country illegally and “likely to escape before a warrant can be obtained.”

In practice, Hunker said, ICE agents routinely make warrantless arrests regardless of how likely their target is to flee. He added no law requires federal agents to show their faces, something that‘s alarmed community members in high-profile instances where masked officers abducted immigrants, such as in the case of Tufts doctoral student Rümeysa Öztürk.

Immigration officials’ aggressive tactics, and what critics describe as a lack of due process for those detained, have made it difficult to discern which reports are real. Last week, as claims of officials detaining nannies at playgrounds spread rapidly on social media, ICE’s acting Boston field director released a statement saying the rumors were “entirely false” and “amount to nothing more than scare tactics.”

Resistance to new immigration policies began in Massachusetts well before Trump’s second administration. Somerville, for example, months ago passed a resolution reaffirming its status as a “sanctuary city,” an often-politicized term referring to officials’ pledge to support immigrants in part by not cooperating with federal deportation efforts. Somerville and Chelsea in February sued the Trump administration after they threatened to pull funding from cities refusing to support their immigration policies.

Reporting ICE activity to hot lines and showing up to record officers in action has become central to recent resistance to immigration enforcement, as residents have sought to communicate potential threats to immigrants at risk. The hot line run by LUCE saw a huge spike in calls reporting ICE sightings during a recent weeklong-span, receiving more than 650 calls over that period, said Rocha, who showed up “nonstop” to record reported ICE interactions statewide. By comparison, the call line received about 150 calls the week prior.

Rocha said LUCE also saw a surge in people seeking to be trained to answer hotline calls or respond to ICE encounters. The network carefully vets and trains volunteers to monitor situations without directly intervening so they don‘t run into legal trouble.

Lucy Pineda, founder of Latinos Unidos en Massachusetts who is operating a database of videos and information to determine who is being detained by ICE, said she saw a similar uptick. People around the state have sent in new videos on a minute-by-minute basis in recent weeks, Pineda said. Her team of around 500 volunteers then works to verify when and where raids are happening.

The goal, Pineda said, is to “educate the community, inform the community, and protect our community, and also have those videos and tell them this is true, that nobody’s lying.”

Grassroots protests, rallies, and vigils have emerged as another way to show solidarity with immigrants and share resources on how to help.

The Allston Brighton Health Collaborative, a community health nonprofit, for instance, announced a Brighton event last week to “condemn ICE’s presence here” and “coordinate our response.” With a few hours notice, the event drew around 100 attendees who listened as advocates spoke of the fear they heard from immigrants afraid they or loved ones could be detained.

Heloisa Galvão, founder of the Brazilian Women‘s Group, described the pain she had heard from immigrant women seeking help from her organization.

“The situation has been bad for immigrants all along … but not at this level," Galvão said. “There are no words to define what‘s going on. This is completely different. This is persecution. This is cruelty, pure cruelty.”

Where she and other organizers have found some solace is seeing community members come together, such as through mutual aid efforts. In Framingham, for instance, residents recently raised $25,000 through a benefit concert for families whose loved ones had been detained.

Deborah Clark, a pastor who spoke at a Framingham protest, said she does not typically wade into national politics but felt particularly compelled to decry what she called “horrifying and unthinkable” actions by ICE officers.

“I’ve always relied on there is a system in place that protects everyone, and for that system to be just so cavalierly ignored is the piece that makes me more outraged,” Clark said. “I see lots and lots of folks who have not understood themselves to be activists saying, ‘I’ve got to be out there.’”
